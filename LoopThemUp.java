     * Write a program that prints numbers 10 to 0 using a while loop and a also a do loop.
     * Thus, you should print 10 to 0 twice but in separate loops.
     * Be careful with the start and end values.
     * Once you have got that running, extend your program so that after printing 10 to 0 twice
     * the program then calculates and prints the sum of the numbers 0 to 10,000
     * i.e. 0+1, 1+2, 3+3, 6 + 4, ... .
     * Use a loop for the calculation.
     * Do you also want to find the complexity of this loop?
